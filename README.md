# Trading Bot

This is a trading bot that has the capability to connect to IBKR and perform algorithmic trading.
1. Stock Price Prediction

	•	Description: The bot uses a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model to predict log-returns of stock prices. GBM is a stochastic model commonly used in finance for modeling stock prices, assuming that prices follow a continuous random walk with drift and volatility.
	•	How it Works: The bot learns parameters such as the drift (average rate of return) and volatility from historical data to simulate future price movements. Based on this model, it forecasts price trends and identifies buy and sell opportunities.
	•	Value: This model helps the bot make statistically grounded predictions about stock movements, generating actionable buy and sell signals. These signals form the basis of the bot’s trading actions, aiming to capitalize on anticipated price changes.

2. Risk Management (Stop-Loss and Take-Profit)

	•   Description: The bot includes stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms to manage risk and lock in gains.
	•	Stop-Loss: If a trade goes against the predicted direction, the stop-loss will automatically trigger an exit when a predefined loss threshold is reached, preventing further losses.
	•	Take-Profit: This feature allows the bot to close a trade once a set profit target is achieved, ensuring that gains are secured without waiting for further market fluctuations.

3. Backtesting

	•	How it Works: The bot applies the same trading rules and signals it would use in live trading to historical stock data, simulating how it would have performed. During backtesting, the bot logs each trade’s entry and exit, calculates profit and loss, and generates performance metrics.

4. Hyperparameter Optimization (Grid Search)

	•	How it Works: Grid search involves testing various combinations of key parameters, such as stop-loss and take-profit levels, moving average windows, and other model-specific factors. The bot runs backtests for each parameter combination and evaluates performance to find the optimal set of parameters.


5. Performance Evaluation (Sharpe Ratio and Cumulative Returns)

	•	Description: The bot evaluates its performance using quantitative metrics such as Sharpe ratio and cumulative returns.
	•	Sharpe Ratio: This metric calculates the risk-adjusted return, measuring how much excess return the bot generates per unit of risk. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.
	•	Cumulative Returns: This metric tracks the total return generated by the bot over a specified period, showing the growth of an investment over time.

6. Live Deployment

	•	Description: The bot can be deployed in a live trading environment, allowing it to execute trades in real-time based on current market data.
	•	How it Works: Integrated with a broker API, such as Interactive Brokers (IBKR), the bot continuously monitors real-time stock prices, applies its model to predict movements, and automatically places buy and sell orders based on its signals and risk management rules.

This trading bot combines statistical modeling with robust risk management and performance evaluation to create a tool for both backtesting and live trading:
	•	Stock Price Prediction: Uses GBM for predictive insights into price movements.
	•	Risk Management: Protects capital with stop-loss and take-profit orders.
	•	Backtesting: Validates strategies on historical data.
	•	Hyperparameter Optimization: Fine-tunes parameters for maximum returns.
	•	Performance Evaluation: Measures effectiveness with key metrics.
	•	Live Deployment: Enables real-time trading using IBKR API
